    <h2>Corporate Policy</h2>
    <p>We are pleased to onboard you into this summer’s performance initiative, a carefully structured series of workshops and programmed set pieces designed to optimize both individual output and collective cohesion. At AFX, we are committed to cultivating a disciplined yet inclusive environment—one where excellence in movement is matched by strategic social integration. We look forward to a productive and synergistic season of growth, alignment, and calibrated artistic expression.</p>
    <br>
    <p>(Welcome to the AFX Corporation! We've prepared an excellent series of workshops and set pieces that we are super excited to share with all of you. We want this team to be an open and accepting place where we can all not only grow as dancers, but also meet some friends along the way. We hope you're looking forward to this summer as much as we are!!)</p>
    <br>
    <p>This team has two 2.5 hour practices each week, to be held at Lower Sproul. Additional practices may be scheduled as necessary as we get towards our performances. Practice times are:</p>
    <h3>Monday 7:00 - 9:30 PM</h3>
    <h3>Thursday 7:00 - 9:30 PM</h3>
    <br>
    <p>All practices are mandatory. OUR FIRST PRACTICE IS JULY 3RD, THURSDAY.</p>
    <p>We know that some may be traveling for July 4th, so if you will not be there, please reach out to us via Discord or Facebook Messenger - our contact information can be found on the About Us page (though we would absolutely love it if you could join us).</p>
    <p>Aside from that, you are allowed 2 unexcused absences, after which there may be punishments.</p>
    <p>To have an excused absence, please contact both directors at least 24 hours before the practice starts. You will be in charge of making up any material that you may miss.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Dues for AFX are $30. We'll discuss this at the first practice, but if money is a concern, please reach out to us privately.</p>
    <p>Make sure to look through the About Us and Important Forms section as well!</p>
